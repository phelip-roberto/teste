# Hello! Welcome to our React Test!

We've prepared some questions for you to answer.

For each question:
* Create a new branch called: `feature/{question}`, ie: `feature/question1`;
* Write your answer inside the equivalent component (inside the `src/` directory);
* Once you finish it, create a PR back to `main`.

Once you finish all questions, please contact us and we will review your test.

## General "rules"

1. Feel free to search the internet for things you don't know or are not sure about;
2. Don't import any external library. For question 4 you can import and use `Axios` (it's included in the project already);
3. Don't worry about styling your components. Your code should be clean and well documented instead;

## How to run this project?

2. Run it in the terminal: `yarn start` or `npm start`;
